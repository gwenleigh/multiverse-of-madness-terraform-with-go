# CRUD Functions

As we move on to 2 5 0 and 2 6 0, we will see the CRUD functions in action. One interesting thing to note is, though, that **the CRUDs are **<mark style="color:red;">**NOT**</mark>** explicitly called anywhere in our project code** (no function calls in `main.tf`). This is because these CRUDs are defined for the <mark style="color:purple;">**Terraform SDK**</mark>. They are invoked automatically by Terraform based on the configurations specified in our terraform configuration files (`main.tf`).

* <mark style="color:purple;">**SDK**</mark>...? ðŸ¤¨ : Terraform SDK (Software Development Kit) is the set of libraries and tools provided by HashiCorp for developing custom Terraform providers.
* This <mark style="color:purple;">**SDK**</mark> provides a plugin framework which allows us to build custom plugins ([providers](../../2-3-0-custom-terraform-provider-resource-skeleton-go.md) and provisioners) which is loaded by Terraform. Using the <mark style="color:purple;">**SDK**</mark>, we can create **custom resource types** and execute **custom actions** during Terraform's lifecycle.
  * **custom resource type**: `terrahouse`
  * **custom actions**: the CRUD functions
